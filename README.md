# flash-cards
A flashcard app to help me remember vocabulary.

This app will evolve as I learn more skills.

--stage 1

data pairs storage : hardcoded into the script file.
interface : minimal plain cards and inputs

--stage 2

Add more functionality, possible features:
    -Score counter
    -score system toggle (mistake counts as 0 or -1)
    -color blind aid
    -card limit, keeps drawing cards until a threshold set by user is reached
    -timer
    -keyboard access

This a list of potential features, some might get eventually created in future stages
